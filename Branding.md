### üéØ What is the purpose of your brand in today's market?

Angor aims to revolutionize crowdfunding by leveraging Bitcoin and blockchain technology to offer a decentralized, secure, and transparent platform. Our goal is to reduce the barriers and risks associated with traditional crowdfunding. Angor provides investors with unprecedented control over their funds, making it the platform investors demand founders use. In today's market, where trust in open-source projects can be challenging to establish, Angor ensures that founders have a strong incentive to perform well and deliver on their promises. By giving investors the power to manage how their funds are utilized, we eliminate the risks of mismanagement and foster a safer, more reliable investment environment.

### üí™ What are your capabilities and strengths?

Angor's strengths lie in our advanced use of blockchain technology and our innovative approach to enabling transparent and secure transactions. As a truly decentralized platform, Angor is unstoppable and open-source, with no backend, no KYC requirements, and no data tracking. All transactions are conducted on the Bitcoin network, ensuring maximum security and transparency. Our experienced team in fintech leverages features like time-lock contracts and direct communications through Nostr, allowing investors to recover their remaining Bitcoin with a time-lock penalty, without any third-party approval. This unique combination of technology, expertise, and market positioning makes Angor a leader in the decentralized crowdfunding space.

### üéØ Who specifically are your target customers?

Our target customers are tech-savvy investors interested in cryptocurrency and startups seeking alternative funding routes. Angor specifically appeals to Bitcoiners who hodl, as it mitigates the risks associated with investing in the Bitcoin space. By providing a secure platform for funding open-source developers and projects, we reduce concerns about scams and undelivered projects. Additionally, founders who aim to demonstrate their integrity and build a solid reputation for their projects will find Angor an attractive choice. This makes Angor a powerful platform for both investors seeking control and security, and founders committed to transparency and success.

### üåê Which industry does your business belong to?

Angor operates within the financial technology industry, specifically in the crowdfunding sector, with a strong emphasis on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Our platform is deeply rooted in the Bitcoin space, supporting open-source projects and venture capital investments. Angor caters to Bitcoin investors and funders who raise capital in cryptocurrency for their projects, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world of blockchain.

### üíé Do you have a clear and unique proposition?

Yes, Angor uniquely combines Bitcoin‚Äôs security with Nostr‚Äôs communication capabilities to create a crowdfunding platform where investments are transparent and funds can be retrieved at any time, significantly reducing investor risk. Our core principle is safeguarding investors' funds, ensuring that the wealth they choose to allocate to founders is properly protected. As a truly decentralized platform, Angor eliminates any intermediary entities between investors and founders. By utilizing blockchain and Nostr, we facilitate direct and secure interactions, ensuring fair play from both sides throughout the funding process.

### üèÜ Who are your competitors?

Competitors include traditional crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, as well as other blockchain-based funding platforms such as StartEngine and GoFundMe. Geyser is also a notable competitor. However, unlike these platforms, Angor is unique in its integration of Bitcoin and Nostr, offering a truly decentralized approach. This gives investors unparalleled control over their funds and ensures that the platform cannot be shut down or interfered with by any centralized entity, providing a distinct advantage over other crowdfunding solutions.

### ‚ö° What makes you different from others?

Unlike traditional platforms, Angor provides complete decentralization with enhanced security and transparency, setting us apart from competitors. Our unique approach allows investors full control over their investments, including the ability to withdraw unspent funds at any time. Angor operates without any backend servers, making it unstoppable and uncontrollable. By utilizing Nostr for communication, anyone can run their own relay and indexer, ensuring the platform remains resilient and independent. This combination of investor control, decentralization, and security gives Angor a distinct edge in the crowdfunding space.

### üõ°Ô∏è What is your brand personality?

Angor is innovative, trustworthy, and forward-thinking. It is dedicated to protecting investors' funds and ensuring they maintain control over their investments. Angor values privacy, allowing investors to remain private if they choose. The brand communicates in a straightforward, clear, and professional manner, always prioritizing the security and interests of its users.

### üå± Does your brand have unique values?

Yes, Angor stands for several core values:
- **Transparency:** Ensuring all transactions and interactions on the platform are clear and visible.
- **Security:** Providing a secure environment where funds and data are protected.
- **Empowerment:** Giving investors full control over their investments.
- **Innovation:** Leveraging cutting-edge blockchain and Nostr technology to offer unique solutions.
- **Community Involvement:** Fostering a community where users can interact freely and securely in a peer-to-peer manner.
- **Decentralization:** Maintaining a permissionless and censorship-resistant platform.
- **Control to Investors:** Ensuring that investors have the ultimate say over their funds.
- **Censorship Resistance:** Protecting the platform from any external control or interference.

These values collectively create a platform that is free, secure, and dedicated to the interests of its users.

### üö´ How do you prefer your brand not to be perceived?

Angor should not be perceived as overly complex, inaccessible, or as risky as typical cryptocurrency investments. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly, transparent, and secure platform that makes Bitcoin investments approachable and manageable for both seasoned investors and newcomers. Angor should be recognized as the premier platform for raising funds, catering to both investors and founders with a streamlined and efficient process. Additionally, Angor is designed for substantial investments, not for minor transactions due to the inherent fees on the Bitcoin network. For smaller investments, platforms like Geyser are more suitable. These features help us position our brand as a trustworthy and reliable option in the world of Bitcoin investments and avoid misunderstandings.

### üé® What do you want your brand to look like?

Angor's visual identity should be modern, approachable, and simple, reflecting its innovative and secure nature. The color palette includes #f89400 (a vibrant orange) for energy and innovation, and #1f5d6a (a deep sea blue) for trust and stability. These colors should be used consistently across our logo, website, and promotional materials to maintain a professional appearance. The design should convey a sense of security, making investors feel confident and comfortable when using the Angor platform.

### üìù What is your brand promise, and how do you intend to fulfill it?

Our promise is to provide a secure, transparent, and user-friendly crowdfunding experience. We fulfill this by continuously enhancing our technology and ensuring user data is protected and transactions are transparent. As an investor, you will always have control of your funds, and as a founder, using Angor demonstrates your commitment to integrity and seriousness. We achieve this by utilizing Bitcoin smart contracts, ensuring that investor funds are prioritized and safeguarded, making investing a secure and reassuring process.

### üìñ What is your brand story?

Angor was born from a desire to democratize the funding process, allowing innovators and investors to connect directly without the need for intermediaries, using the security and efficiency of blockchain technology. The idea for Angor emerged from personal experiences with failed investments and ICO scams, where founders did not deliver on promises and ignored investor tokens. This frustration and the feeling of having no control over the direction of projects led to the creation of Angor. Our platform aims to protect investors and bring new investors who are hesitant to invest in the Bitcoin space by ensuring that if founders do not play fair, investors have the power to take their money back. Angor empowers investors with control and transparency, creating a safer and more reliable investment environment.

### üîç How will you capture the market's attention?

We will engage our audience through targeted digital marketing campaigns, partnerships with tech influencers, and by hosting webinars and workshops that educate potential users about the benefits of blockchain and decentralized funding. Additionally, we will leverage platforms such as Nostr, Bitcointalk, Reddit, Twitter, Stakernews, and Delving Bitcoin to reach our target audience. Attending Bitcoin events and conferences will be crucial for getting people to see and use Angor, as well as gathering valuable investor feedback. This multi-faceted approach will help us capture market attention and build a strong community around Angor.

### üìä How will you measure the success of your brand?

Success will be measured by the volume of funds raised through the platform, user growth rate, engagement on our platform and social media, and feedback from users regarding their satisfaction and trust in our services. Additionally, we will gauge success by the number of projects being raised on Angor and the level of trust and usage by both founders and investors. Achieving a high level of trust and active participation from both sides will be key indicators of our brand's success.
